OsiConicCut and OsiConicCuts:
OsiConicCuts is a class of general cuts. A proper name should just be OsiCuts.
But this name is already used in cut class of Osi which implements only linear cuts.
Due to this we name extended OsiCuts class as OsiConicCuts. OsiConicCuts is a general
class that can hold both conic and linear cuts. It is a general cut container that
can contain linear and conic cuts. Same reasoning holds for OsiConicCut.

I mainly do this since I do not have write and extend access to Osi. If I had
the access I would have keep the class names and just extend all interfaces
for conic problems.
